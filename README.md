This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project uses React and Redux to create an app that facilitates decision-making, by allowing users to enter pros and cons of an issue they are trying to decide, and weights for each pro and con. The app suggests whether the user should act in the affirmative or negative based on the total pro weights minus the total con weights. 

The app can be used here:
